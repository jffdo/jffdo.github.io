<h1>{{ "Hello World!" | downcase }}</h1>
<p>Welcome to my personal website! My name is Jeffrey Do, I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a B.A in Computer Science.</p>
<p>Currently, if you stumble on to this webpage, you can see that this website is barebones and part tutorial project. Hopefully in the future, you can see this website with a new look!</p>
<li>
  Here is what I am planning for this website:
  <ul>
    To showcase personal projects with in-depth explanations on the thought process.
  </ul>
  <ul>
    A place to get started in web development.
  </ul>
  <ul>
    A archive for all my future projects.
  </ul>
</li>
<p>Hopefully, you should see changes to this website and learn more about me along the way!</p>
<p>Thanks for coming by!</p>
